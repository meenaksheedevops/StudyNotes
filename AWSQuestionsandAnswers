Q5) What are the pricing models for EC2instances?
Answer:The different pricing model for EC2 instances are as below,
• On-demand
• Reserved
• Spot
• Scheduled
• Dedicated

Q6) What are the types of volumes for EC2 instances?

Answer:
• There are two types of volumes,
• Instance store volumes
• EBS – Elastic Block Stores

Q7) What are EBS volumes?
Answer:EBS stands for Elastic Block Stores. They are persistent volumes that you can attach to the
instances. With EBS volumes, your data will be preserved even when you stop your instances, unlike
your instance store volumes where the data is deleted when you stop the instances.

Q8) What are the types of volumes in EBS?
Answer:Following are the types of volumes in EBS,
• General purpose
• Provisioned IOPS
• Magnetic
• Cold HDD
• Throughput optimized

Q9) What are the different types of instances?
Answer: Following are the types of instances,
• General purpose
• Computer Optimized
• Storage Optimized
• Memory Optimized
• Accelerated Computing

Q10) What is an auto-scaling and what are the components?
Answer: Auto scaling allows you to automatically scale-up and scale-down the number of instances
depending on the CPU utilization or memory utilization. There are 2 components in Auto scaling, they

Q11) What are reserved instances?
Answer: Reserved instances are the instance that you can reserve a fixed capacity of EC2 instances. In
reserved instances you will have to get into a contract of 1 year or 3 years.

Q12)What is an AMI?
Answer: AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. AMI is a template that contains the software
configurations, launch permission and a block device mapping that specifies the volume to attach to
the instance when it is launched.

Q13) What is an EIP?

Answer: EIP stands for Elastic IP address. It is designed for dynamic cloud computing. When you
